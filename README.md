# CamBot
CamBot uses web scraping, machine learning, and sql connectivity to bring users all information on Rust skins and items. Currently, all data for items is scraped from rustlabs.com and inserted into a database on a monthly basis. This ensures that item data is always up to date and quick to access. CamBot also uses machine learning with past skin prices/colors in order to give users access to price data on every skin released and attempt to predict future skin prices. See below for a list of commands and their functions. Additionally, CamBot can be used to post announcements for the most recent devblog/skins/news as soon as they are updated. Once a new devblog, item store update, or Rustafied news article is published CamBot will post an update in the Discord server and send out a tweet at https://twitter.com/CamBot4
